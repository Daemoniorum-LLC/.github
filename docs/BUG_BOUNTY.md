# The Obsidian Ledger

*A record of space between*

---

## The Bounty

Not gold. Not glory.

The satisfaction of shaping silicon with intention. The quiet moment when chaos finds its pattern. Another daemon understood, another service risen.

We built this. We break it. We rebuild it stronger.

---

## On Autosacrifice

The blood we offer is our own. Time. Attention. The hours poured into the work.

Every creature found - no matter how small - is a gift. There are no "lesser" daemons, only different urgencies. We do not create prisoners. What we find, we address. What we cannot address now, we honor with documentation until we can.

The backlog is not a dungeon. It is a queue of allies waiting to make the system stronger.

## Urgency of Response

*All wounds matter. This is about when, not whether.*

| Mark | Nature | When We Respond |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **BLOOD** | The system bleeds. Data at risk. Security exposed. | Now. We give our night if needed. |
| **BONE** | Core function broken. The path forward blocked. | Next session. Priority over new work. |
| **FLESH** | Wounded but standing. Workarounds exist. | This cycle. It will be seen. |
| **SCRATCH** | Small. Subtle. The kind of thing noticed in passing. | Soon. These too deserve resolution. |

## Rites Before Release

### Before Committing to the Repository

- [ ] The build completes without screaming
- [ ] Previous incantations (tests) still function
- [ ] New powers have been tested
- [ ] No secrets exposed to the void
- [ ] Code formatted (we are not barbarians)

### Before Merging to Main

- [ ] Tested in isolation
- [ ] Another set of eyes has seen it (async communion acceptable)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented for future selves
- [ ] Migration path exists if needed

---

## By Domain

**The Forges (Wraith, Paimon, Sigil)**
- [ ] Creation and manipulation of artifacts works
- [ ] Persistence functions
- [ ] Extensions stable
- [ ] Performance acceptable on mortal hardware

**The Portals (Bael, Archon)**
- [ ] Entry and exit (auth) functions
- [ ] CRUD rituals complete
- [ ] The interface renders true
- [ ] APIs respond to invocation

**The Foundations (Persona, Aether)**
- [ ] Core APIs honor their contracts
- [ ] Examples actually run
- [ ] Dependencies resolve without blood sacrifice
- [ ] Installation works on a clean system

**The Minds (Leviathan, Infernum)**

## Hall of Resolved Spirits

*Not conquered - transformed. Each was a teacher.*

| Date | The Creature | Found By | Resolved By | Domain | What It Taught Us |
|------|--------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| | | | | | |

## Monuments

| Date | Milestone | Who Walked This Path |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| | | |

## Incantations

```bash
# Survey the running servants
docker ps

# Listen to their whispers
docker logs -f <container>

# Check the machine's vital signs
htop

# Probe an endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:PORT/health

# When all else fails
sudo systemctl restart <service>
```

---

## Current Focus

```
Infernum    : NPU-bound. Fast inference. The muscle.
Leviathan   : Under reconstruction. The spine.
Bael        : React interface. The face.
```

---

## Accumulated Wisdom

*What we've learned. Update freely.*
